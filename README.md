#Swift sample application - Texter

This is a simple command line Swift App.  It allows the user to send SMS messages
using the Clock Work API.

#Parameters for running the APP

1. The App will ask for the text to be send.  Just type the content to be send and
press ENTER.  If the user just press ENTER without entering any content to be
send the App will exit.

2. The App will ask for the cellphone number which will receive the message.  It
does the same if the user doesn't enter anything.
